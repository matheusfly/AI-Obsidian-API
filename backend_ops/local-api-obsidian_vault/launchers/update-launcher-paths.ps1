## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Each file type has its dedicated directory
2. **Easy Navigation**: Logical grouping makes finding files intuitive
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, organized structure
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to add new files in appropriate categories
5. **Scalable**: Structure can grow with the project
6. **Preserved Functionality**: All launchers work with updated paths
