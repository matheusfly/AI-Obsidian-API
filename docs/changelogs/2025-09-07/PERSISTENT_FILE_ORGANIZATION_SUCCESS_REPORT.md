## 🔧 **FEATURE WORKFLOW**

### **1. Feature Start Workflow**
```powershell
# Start new feature development
.\cleanup_system\persistent_file_organization.ps1 -Action create_temp -FeatureName "new_feature"

# This creates:
# - scripts/temp/feature_development/new_feature/
# - scripts/temp/active_tests/new_feature/
# - temp_files/logs/new_feature/
# - temp_files/reports/new_feature/
```

### **2. Feature Development Workflow**
```powershell
# Develop feature with organized temp files
# All files go to appropriate temp folders
# Maintain clean organization during development
```

### **3. Feature Completion Workflow**
```powershell
# Complete feature development
.\cleanup_system\persistent_file_organization.ps1 -Action move_to_definitive -FeatureName "new_feature"

# This moves files from temp to definitive locations:
# - Python files → core_services/ or appropriate directory
# - Test files → test_suites/
# - Scripts → deployment/ or appropriate directory
# - Documentation → docs/
```

### **4. Feature Cleanup Workflow**
```powershell
# Clean up after feature completion
.\cleanup_system\comprehensive_cleanup.ps1

# This removes temp files and maintains clean structure
```
