# Vector Databases

## Introduction
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for AI applications that rely on semantic similarity search.

## Key Features

### High-Dimensional Vector Storage
- Store vectors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions
- Efficient compression and storage techniques
- Support for various vector types (dense, sparse, binary)

### Similarity Search
- Fast nearest neighbor search
- Multiple distance metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot product)
- Approximate search algorithms for scalability

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling across multiple nodes
- Distributed indexing and querying
- Real-time updates and insertions
